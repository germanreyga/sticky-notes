# Sticky Notes app

## About this project

This is a small React project I created as front-end practice. Drag and drop functionality is implemented with [dnd kit](https://dndkit.com/).

Users can:

-   Add/remove/edit sticky notes
-   Create clusters to group sticky notes in
-   Group sticky notes into clusters
-   Move sticky notes from one cluster to another
-   Zoom in/zoom out of the whiteboard, resizing the tool components themselves
-   Persist app data thanks to local storage

Current limitations:

-   Users cannot order the sticky notes manually
-   Users cannot edit/delete clusters. To do this, local storage data needs to be edited/deleted manually using the Browser's DevTools

## Run the project

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

Then, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
